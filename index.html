                <h1><em>Anime</em> , and it's popularity in <em>India</em></h1>

                <time datetime="30-5-2021">May. 30,2021</time>
                <h2>What is <em>Anime?</em></h2>
                <p>
                    Who are not familiar with anime may think that it's just cartoon <del>and technically it is</del> , but it's more than just 
                    cartoon . While tradition cartoon targets children as their consumer , <em>anime</em> don't have such restriction and it
                    targets audience of all age group. That's the most basic difference between cartoon and <em>anime</em> . But that's not 
                    all there is to <em>anime</em> , <em>anime fans</em> will also argue that anime should be limited to animation which
                    is produced in <em>Japan</em> and by <em>Japan</em>. So generally, western cartoons are not considered "<em>anime</em>" 
                    . <em>Anime</em> and <em>Japan</em> are inseparable to the point that , many outsiders develop their opinions on  <em>Japan</em> through 
                    <em>anime</em>. <em>Anime</em> is one of key factors in establishing <em>Japan's</em> soft power all over the world .

                <h2>How popular <em>Anime</em> is?</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Anime</em> is quite popular nowadays and it's popularity is not just limited to kids and teenagers. It's popularity 
                    is exploding in West( Western Nations) in recent years. Just to get a rough idea about it , let me tell you that the highest grossing
                    movie in year 2020 worldwide was an <em>anime</em> movie titled <em>"The Demon Slayer"</em> . Ofcourse that's not something that usually 
                    happen and pandemic may also play a part in it but this shows the popularity of <em>anime</em> is huge and it's only going to increase 
                    more in the near future. One of the main reasons for it's popularity  it's beautiful art which is traditionally hand drawn and unique which captures 
                    attention of many and another is the different content flavours that <em>anime</em> in general have which is unique on it's own.
                    Anime title like <em>Shingeki No Kyojin</em> which is known by name <em>Attack On Titan</em> has attracted attention of even many 
                    stars in hollywood.

                <h2><em>Anime</em> industry in present and it's growth</h2>
                <p>
                    By 2020, The <em>Anime Market</em> is valued at USD 24.23 Billion in 2020  and is estimated to cross USD 40 Billion . Yes, you read
                    it right . Entertainment giants like <em>Netflix</em> currently investing big in <em>anime</em> . Anime streaming platforms like <em>Crunchyroll</em>
                    and <em>Funanimation</em> have only growing that by day . Just few months ago, Sonny's subsidiary Funanimation bought <em>Crunchyroll</em>
                    for a whopping $ 1.2 Billion USD , which may lead to monopoly of anime streaming services by Sony. considering all these competition we can expect anime industry 
                    to grow in future . Though even if anime Industy is growing at such a fast pace , the backbone of <em>anime</em> industy , the <em>artist</em>
                    who draw anime don't get any benefits . Their work shedule are almost insane and from various reports that come out , it is said 
                    that their pay rate has been same for many years which considering all the growth is not good .  
                </p>
                <h2><em>Anime</em> in India</h2>
                <p>
                    Anime in India is not as popular in other parts of world . One of the main reason behind is that anime is not availability 
                    of anime in regional local languages  and there is also not any legal streaming services which focus on presenting anime
                    content in India. Crunchyroll is available in India but only some are available for Indian audience which compare to what other 
                    parts of world get to have , is like a fraction of it . Still anime's popularity is growing in India in recent times , particularly among 
                    youths. 
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Anime now has become a brand of it's own with lot of fans worldwide which is expected to only increase in number.
                    So , have you guys ever watch anime? if yes, then do you like it? 
                    or do you guys have any prejudice against anime ?
                    if any one is interested to try out anime , then i will recommend to start with Demon slayer as it's the most famous and liked one recently.
